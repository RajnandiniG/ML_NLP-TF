# ML_NLP-TF
This repository contains two main components:  TensorFlow Image Prediction Model: A neural network built using TensorFlow that predicts classes of images and evaluates the model's accuracy. NLP Models Using BERT and Transformers: Various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks performed using the BERT model and the transformers library.

#TensorFlow Image Prediction Model
Model Architecture
The image prediction model is built using TensorFlow's Keras API. It uses a sequential model with the following layers:

1. Flatten layer to convert input images from 2D to 1D.
2. Dense layers with ReLU activation.
3. Final dense layer for classification.

#NLP Models Using BERT and Transformers
It also includes various NLP tasks using the BERT model and the transformers library.

1. Text Classification
Classifying whole sentences into predefined categories.

2. Token Classification
Classifying each word in a sentence, useful for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER).

3. Question Answering
Answering questions based on a given context using BERT's question-answering pipeline.

4. Text Summarization
Summarizing long texts into concise summaries using transformers.

5. Fill in the Blanks
Using masked language models to fill in missing words in sentences.

6. Translation
Translating text from one language to another using transformers.
